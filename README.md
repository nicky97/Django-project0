# dj-com-project
HTML and CSS project

# Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/qpick/dj-com-project
cd dj-com-project
```

# Submit your work

Please create a new branch with your username

```
git branch "USERNAME"
git checkout "USERNAME"
```

Use status git command

```
git status
```

to confirm that you are in the correct branch.

**Note**: replace username with the name of your github user
**Note**: if your push by mistake to master or other branch, please notify your mentor, it's ok :).

After each requirement is solved, please commit and push, usually daily

```
git add somefile
git commit -m "I solved requirement X"
git push origin master
```

**Note**: Optionally if your requirement is not complete and you want to show  your partial work, add WIP: (work in progress text) before the commit message, e.g:

```git commit -m "WIP: working on requirement X"```
This is useful if you want your mentor to guide you with something.
